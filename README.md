# HexBot
A discord bot for all sorts of purposes, moderation, fun, and other stuff.


## Quick And Easy Setup
### Requirements
1. Node.js (any recent version should work, if not, update to a more recent version)
2. A decent code editor (not notepad, for me, i used [Brackets](http://brackets.io/"Brackets")
3. Some basic understanding of javascript.
### Setup
1. Create a file.js (you can name it anything but make sure its a js file...)
2. Open up the file you made, and take the code i gave you from bot.js, and paste it into the file. 
3. Now, paste your bot token into the code ```Eris.CommandClient("BOT_TOKEN", {}, {
    description: "A test bot made entirely",
    owner: "Axiatinc",
    prefix: "!"
});``` where it says "BOT_TOKEN" (if you dont know how to get your token, go to this quick and easy guide on how to do this: [How to get a bot token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token"How to get a bot token"
4. Save that file.
5. Open up your command prompt, and use cd ```C:Your\file\directory```
6. Then type ```node file.js``` into the command prompt after step 5.
7.Your bot should be ready! If you have any questions just message me on discord at Juuzou Suzuya#6044, or join our support server [HexBot Support Server](https://discord.gg/QtQBHcW)"HexBot Support Server".
